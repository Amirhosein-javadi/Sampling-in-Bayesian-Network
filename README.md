# Sampling in Bayesian Network

In this assignment, we will implement diffrent methods of sampling and try to compare the methods by varying queries and number of samples. In the next section you will implement Bayesian Network as a Python class with these methods:

* CPT: returns conditional probability table of nodes
* PMF: returns probability mass function of given query
* Sampling: implementation of different sampling methods
    
We will use following BN in this problem.

* Prior Sampling
* Rejection Sampling
* Likelihood Weighting
* Gibbs Sampling
